Description: Fit hierarchical renewal and trend renewal processes to the eruption records
                of multiple volcanoes using JAGS. Find statistical analogues for a target volcano and
                use these to help produce forecasts for the next eruption at the target volcano.
                Use model averaging to combine the posterior distribution for the forecast times 
                produced by different models.
